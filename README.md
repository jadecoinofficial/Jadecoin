What is Jadecoin?
----------------

Jadecoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Jadecoin uses a proof-of-work method in order for
the Jadecoin blockchain network to achieve distributed consensus. Jadecoin is
the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the
Jadecoin software, see https://www.jadecoin.com/#wallet.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Jadecoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
official discord.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see [doc/coding.md](doc/coding.md)) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable.
